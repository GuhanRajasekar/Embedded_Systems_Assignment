Inorder to do different lab assignments wrapper drivers were made for
all the peripherals we used in the assignments. and these drivers are 
split in to one *.c and one *.h file per device and are arranged in the 
project folder structure 

this driver set was used to write all application programs 

only one pproject is created for all the lab assignments "TivawareProject"

Only the AppMain.c file is changed in the assignments and a backup of all
these AppMain.C files is kept in ECSDWorkSpace/AppmainAll folder

The folder structure of the ECSDLabProject is as follows

Debug - folder created by CCS for uotput and temp files

Headers				- All header files
	App
		"App.h"
	Genlib
		"GenLib.h"  	- hardware independent lib
	Devices
 		"TIResources.h"

		"DigitalInputPort.h"
		"ADC.h"
		"PWM.h"
		"Devices.h"
